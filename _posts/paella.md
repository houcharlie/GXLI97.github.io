title: Paella

The past few weeks, I've been cooking paella at home and trying to perfect my technique!

## Ingredients
I bought all of my ingredients at Whole Foods. I was trying to be as authentic as possible, but unfortunately Whole Foods was lacking in some ingredients and I had to make substitutions/deletions. For example, I replaced Spanish Bomba rice with Arborio, and could not find langoustines. But I think I got most of the rest of the ingredients!

## Attempt 1
I used a 10-inch cast iron skillet and tried to follow [this recipe][1] as closely as possible. I made the decision to halve the size. Here is my finished product:

What worked:

* The amount of paprika/oregano/saffron added was a good amount. I was afraid it would turn out either too bland or too spiced.
* Fresh littleneck clams are *really good*. 

What didn't work:

* Overfilled the pan. It was way too crowded, and as a result, kind of gloopy. The rice was a little bit past *al dente*. I was unable to get the socarrat when I took it off the heat initially, so I put it back on high heat, and burned the bottom of the rice :(
* The shrimp was kinda rubbery and bland, but this may be because it wasn't particularly fresh. 
* The ingredients didn't blend together that well. Each individual component basically tasted like it had been cooked by itself. The rice tasted just like spiced rice. I think this was a result of overcrowding the pan.

Overall, I would give it a 5/10. I was expecting to make a 3/10 on my first attempt, so it surpassed my expectations. 

## Interlude: Paella at Ostra

In order to get a quality frame of reference on what a good paella should taste like, I visited [Ostra][2], a Mediterranean seafood place in Boston that is known for its Paella Valenciana, among other dishes. Here's a picture of the dish:

A few thoughts:

* Compared to mine first attempt, their dish was very flat (~1 inch deep). Their pan wasn't that much bigger than my skillet, but it was very flat and shallow.
* The rice was much more flavorful than mine, and it tasted more briney/fishy (fish stock?). I did not know that a rice dish could have so much flavor.
* Clams and mussels had a wine taste? Perhaps were soaked in wine? But very *pure* tasting.
* All the seafood was cooked perfectly, not over or underdone!
* The octopus was very clean tasting with a touch of pepper, very interesting.
* There wasn't really a socarrat at the bottom.

Would give it a 9/10.


## Attempt 2
On this attempt, I tried to make these changes:

* Don't overcrowd the pan. I used a flatter stainless steel skillet
* Less chicken, more seafood (add mussels).
* Experiment with garnishes (fresh chopped parsley and frozen peas). The recipe in Attempt 1 called for frozen peas as garnish, which confused me so I just didn't add them in. But apparently you just sprinkle the frozen peas on top, and they more or less cook. 
* I kind of just winged it without really following a recipe, just doing the steps as done in the first attempt. I decided to put in chicken stock instead of water.

My second attempt can be seen here:

What worked:
* Rice was not as plain as the first attempt, and it was the correct consistency. Was this a result of the chicken stock? I also think the seafood flavors infused more heavily this time.
* Garnishes are really easy to put on and make the presentation very nice.

What didn't work:
* Wow, I really need to pare down the ingredients for my pan size. It was still overflowing!
* I added too much stock/water - the resulting dish was excessively watery.
* Burned the bottom when I tried to make the *socarrat*.

I would give it a 6/10. My overall takeway from this attempt is that you really need to be careful about how much you are putting in - more ingredients is not necessarily better. Also, the principal difficulty in making a good paella is cooking the rice well - getting the right consistency and crunchiness at the bottom - and not the seafood/meat (which is almost impossible to mess up).

Here are some of the projects/research I've been involved in.

### Political Journalists Network

I worked with Prof. Emmanuel Abbe to create a modern dataset in the flavor of the well known political blogosphere dataset from 2004 [here][1]. Using a list of political journalists active on Twitter, I scraped the graph of follower connections between journalists to build a dataset of political affiliation. Community detection algorithms such as the classical [spectral methods][2], SDP relaxations, and belief propagation were experimented with. A good overview of the community detection for the stochastic block model can be found [here][3].

I hope to clean up the code and dataset and release it soon!

### Earthquake Prediction with Neural Nets

Used a simple neural network to try to predict earthquake occurrences for a freshman seminar. Obviously was not successful, but learned a lot about coding in MATLAB.

### Police App

In summer '15, I made an Android application, intended for use with the Nashville Police Department to replace an outdated radio system for patrol car communication. This was my first programming project, and I learned quite a lot! The code can be found on GitHub [here][2]. It is not being maintained, and is written at the level of someone just learned how to program.

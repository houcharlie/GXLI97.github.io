The past few weeks, I've been cooking paella at home and trying to perfect my technique!

## Ingredients
I bought all of my ingredients at WholeFoods. I was trying to be as authentic as possible, but unfortunately WholeFoods was lacking in some ingredients and I had to make substitutions/deletions. For example, I replaced Spanish Bomba rice with Arborio, and could not find langoustines. But I think I got most of the rest of the ingredients!

## Attempt 1
I used a 10-inch cast iron skillet and tried to follow [this recipe][1] as closely as possible. I made the decision to half the size. Here is my finished product:

What worked:

* The amount of paprika/oregano/saffron added was a good amount. I was afraid it would turn out either too bland or too spiced.
* Fresh littleneck clams are *really good*. 

What didn't work:

* Overfilled the pan. It was way too crowded, and as a result, kind of gloopy. The rice was a little bit past *al dente*. I was unable to get the socarrat when I took it off the heat initially, so I put it back on high heat, and burned the bottom of the rice :(
* The shrimp was kinda rubbery and bland, but this may be because it wasn't particularly fresh. 
* The ingredients didn't blend together that well. Each individual component basically tasted like it had been cooked by itself. The rice tasted just like spiced rice. I think this was a result of overcrowding the pan.

Overall, I would give it a 5/10. I was expecting to make a 3/10 on my first attempt, so it surpassed my expectations. 

## Attempt 2
On this attempt, I tried to make these changes:

* Don't overcrowd the pan. I don't have a large flat skillet, so I had to make do with the 10-inch cast iron.
* Less chicken, more seafood (add mussels).
* Experiment with garnishes (fresh chopped parsley and frozen peas). The recipe in Attempt 1 called for frozen peas as garnish, which confused me so I just didn't add them in. But apparently you just sprinkle the frozen peas on top, and they more or less cook.
